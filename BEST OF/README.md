# BEST OF

## REPorter
Group project about quantum teleportation. It was already used in reality using atoms, but we tried to extend it in theory to teleportation of people and objects.  
We did not prove mathematically that it works. 

## CAN && LIN
Presentation about the CAN and LIN buses, again in group. The slides I handled : 13,14,15,16,25,26  

These group projects were both done with my collegues and friends:
