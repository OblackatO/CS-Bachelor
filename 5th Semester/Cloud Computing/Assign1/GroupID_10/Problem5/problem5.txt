For this problem, please have a look at the file ReduceSideJoin.java
Once you have the jar of it, you can run it with:

hadoop jar project.jar "/home/peterpan/Downloads/yago_full_clean.tsv" output 

You should get an output file, where the format will look similar to:

<Aabid_Nassar>	[(<livesIn>,<Ernakulam>), (<hasGivenName>,<Aabid>)]
...
<Đurađ_Jakšić>	[(<livesIn>,<Novi_Sad>), (<hasGivenName>,<Đurađ>)]
...

[>]You need ofc to replace the path of the yaho dataset to your own
[>]Please do not forget to "rm -Rf output" if subsequent runs.
