### Remark : 
Some folders contain the *correction* of the requested exercises along with my *resolution* of them, others only contain my resolution. 

This is **not** a realistic view of all the contents I have been covering in my Bachelor's Course, there are only some of them that from which the content makes sense to be shared.
